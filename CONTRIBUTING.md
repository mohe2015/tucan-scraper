Any contributions are welcome. Keep in mind that the current code is far from stable and cleaned up.
Please create an issue beforehand or write in an existing issue if you plan to work on something to avoid duplicate work.
Also please wait until your idea is discussed if it's a larger change as there may be different approaches possible.
